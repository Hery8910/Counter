# Simple Counter Project

This is the first project I've created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a simple counter that allows you to increment the count each time you click on the "Add" button. It also allows you to decrement the count and reset the counter.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click the "Add" button to increment the counter.
4. Click the "Subtract" button to decrement the counter.
5. Click the "Reset" button to reset the counter to zero.
